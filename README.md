# Kirby3 xmlsitemap

**Requirement:** Kirby 3

## Documentation

### Purpose

For a kirby3 site, this plugin (_omz13/xmlsitemap_) automatically generates /sitemap.xml and provides a pretty /sitemap.xls too.

Implementation details:

- For all pages, `<loc>` and `<lastmod>` are given.
- For pages at the site's root (i.e. at a depth of 1). the <`priority`> is set to 1.0; for child pages, it is set to 0.9; for grandchildren and below it is not given.
- The generated `sitemap.xls` has an accompanying `sitemap.xsl` to produce a prettified page for human consumption.
- Only pages that have a status of "published" are included (everything else, `drafts` and `unlisted`, are excluded)
<!-- - If a page has the methods `isunderembargo`[^ https://github.com/omz13/kirby3-sunset] or `issunet` [^ https://github.com/omz13/kirby3-sunset] these are respected vis-Ã -vis inclusion or exclusion from the xmlsitemap. -->
- The error page is automatically excluded.
- Pages made using certain templates can be excluded; c.f. the use of `excludePageWhenTemplateIs` in _Configuration_.
- The children of pages made using certain templates can be excluded; c.f. the use of `excludeChildrenWhenTemplateIs` in _Configuration_.
- For debugging purposes, the generated sitemap can include additional information as xml comments; c.f. the use of `debugqueryvalue` in _Configuration_.
- For debugging purposes, the `debug` flag in `site/config.php` needs to be set too.
- Kirby3 is under beta, therefore this plugin, and indeed kirby3 itself, may or may not play nicely with each other, or indeed work at all: use it for testing purposes only; if you use it in production then you should be aware of the risks.

### Installation

#### via composer

If your kirby3-based site is managed-using-composer, simply invoke `composer require omz13/kirby3-xmlsitemap:'@dev'`, or manually add `omz13/kirby3-xmlsitemap` as an item into the 'require' component of your site's `composer.json`:

```
"require": {
  ...
  "omz13/kirby3-xmlsitemap": "@dev",
  ...
}
```

Remember to invoke `composer update --no-dev` as applicable.

#### via git

Clone github.com/omz13/kirby3-xmlsitemap into your `site/plugins` and then in `site/plugins/kirby3-xmlsitemap` invoke ``composer update --no-dev`` to generate the `vendor` folder and the magic within.

```sh
$ git clone github.com/omz13/kirby3-xmlsitemap site/plugins/kirby3-xmlsitemap
$ cd site/plugins/kirby3-xmlsitemap
$ composer update --no-dev
```

If your project itself is under git, then you need to add the plugin as a submodule and possibly automate the composer update; it is assumed if you are doing this that you know what to do.

#### via zip

So you want everything in a zip file you can simply expand into `site/plugins/kirby3-xmlsitemap`? Not yet. Sorry.

### Configuration

The following mechanisms can be used to modify the plugin's behaviour.

#### via `config.php`

In your site's `site/config/config.php` the following entries under the key `omz13.xmlsitemap` can be used:

- `debugqueryvalue` : a string to be as the value for the query parameter `debug` to return the xml-sitemap with debugging information. The global kirby `debug` configuration must also be true for this to work. The url must be to `/sitemap.xml?debug=debugqueryvalue` and not `/sitemap?debug=_debugqueryvalue_` (i.e. the `.xls` part is important). Be aware that the debugging information will show, if applicable, details of any pages that have been excluded (so if you are using this in production and you don't want things to leak, set `debugqueryvalue` to something random).
- `excludePageWhenTemplateIs` : an array of templates names whose pages are to be excluded from the xml-sitemap.
- `excludeChildrenWhenTemplateIs` : an array of templates names whose pages children are to be ignored; this is used for one-pagers (where the principal page will be included and all the 'virtual' children ignored).
- `excludeTopBySlug` : the names of the slugs of pages in the root (\content) that are to be ignored.

For example, for the kirby3 starterkit, the following would be indicative:

```php
<?php

return [
  'omz13.xmlsitemap' => [
    'excludeChildrenWhenTemplateIs' => array('events','one-pager','shop','team','testimonials'),
    'excludePageWhenTemplateIs' => array('sandbox','form')
  ],
];
```

For example, to have a debugged sitemap returned  (at /sitemap.xml?debug=wombat)

```php
<?php

return [
  'debug'  => true,

  'omz13.xmlsitemap' => [
    'debugqueryvalue=wombat',
    'excludeChildrenWhenTemplateIs' => array('events','one-pager','shop','team','testimonials'),
    'excludePageWhenTemplateIs' => array('sandbox','form')
  ],
];
```

#### via `site.txt`

The plugin can be explicitly disabled in `content\site.txt` by having an entry for `xmlsitemap` and setting this to `false`. This could be achieved through the panel by adding the following into `site/blueprints/site.yml`:

```
type:          fields
fields:
  xmlsitemap:
    label:     XML sitemap
    type:      toggle
    default:   off
    test:
      - disabled
      - enabled
```
#### via content fields

If a page's content has a field called `excludefromxmlsitemap` and this is set to `true`, then that page (and any children, if present) will be excluded. Similarly to `site.txt`, this can be easily achieved in a blueprint.

```
type:          fields
fields:
  excludefromxmlsitemap:
    label:     Exclude from sitemap.xml
    type:      toggle
    default:   off
    text:
      - include implicitly
      - explicitly exclude
```

As pages are implicitly included within a sitemap, this mechanism should only be used when you have a reason to explcitly exclude a page  when it is not possible to do otherwise (c.f. excludePageWhenTemplateIs).
